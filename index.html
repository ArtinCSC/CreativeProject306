                                <p>Ethan Turner, a customer of MacRonalds, is suing MacRonalds, for the injuries
                                    suffered from the accident that occurred
                                    in the drive-thru. Mr. Turner wants MacRonalds to remove their robot services from
                                    the drive-thru until the bugs are
                                    fixed. MacRonalds, a fast food chain, has recently come up with a new way to serve
                                    drive-thru items with robots. Ethan
                                    Turner, a customer who wanted to get some food for his friends, visited MacRonalds
                                    and ordered 10 meals that consisted
                                    of a sandwich, fries and hot coffee. After giving the order, Mr. Turner drove up to
                                    the window and handed a 100 dollars
                                    worth of bills in one hand and 78 cents on the other hand, as payment to exchange
                                    with the robot. The robot detected the
                                    hand and began delivering the large order of coffees to Mr. Turner. With his hand
                                    full, Mr. Turner was unable to hold
                                    the meal and this resulted in the hot coffee spilling on him, causing third-degree
                                    burns.</p>
                                <p>The plaintiff Ethan Turner, who suffered third-degree burns at the receiving end of
                                    the miscalculation, insinuated from
                                    the automated drive-thru robot, is suing the defendant MacRonalds on the grounds of
                                    Negligence and is demanding a
                                    preliminary injunction on further usage of the robot until advancement in the
                                    technology is made. Furthermore, he is
                                    seeking payment for the accrued hospital bills for the damages he suffered. The
                                    defendant must disprove the negligence
                                    allegations and show that the plaintiff had violated contributory negligence.

                                    MacRonalds. Both Negligence and
                                    Contributory Negligence have 5 sub-elements that must be proved as outlined in the
                                    Virginia statute. However,
                                    contributory negligence under Virginia law follows the doctrine of pure contributory
                                    negligence which means that if the
                                    plaintiff is even so much as one percent at fault, he/she will have no case. Given
                                    the overwhelming influence of
                                    contributory negligence in Virginia, Only the Duty statute will be expanded upon.

                                                The case involves the legal element of contributory negligence,
                                                specifically the sub-element duty. It involved a motor
                                                accident where the plaintiff had claimed the defendant was negligent on
                                                the road when they collided. However, the court
                                                ruled the case in favor of the defendant, where the defendant was shown
                                                to demonstrate contributory negligence for not
                                                maintaining proper distance.

                                            <p>
                                                This case would help the defendant demonstrate that the plaintiff cannot
                                                simply claim negligence without proper
                                                evidence. If the plaintiff cannot prove that they had absolutely zero
                                                responsibility involved, it can be ruled in the
                                                defendant’s favor.
