                                <p>Ethan Turner, a customer of MacRonalds, is suing MacRonalds, for the injuries
                                    suffered from the accident that occurred
                                    in the drive-thru. Mr. Turner wants MacRonalds to remove their robot services from
                                    the drive-thru until the bugs are
                                    fixed. MacRonalds, a fast food chain, has recently come up with a new way to serve
                                    drive-thru items with robots. Ethan
                                    Turner, a customer who wanted to get some food for his friends, visited MacRonalds
                                    and ordered 10 meals that consisted
                                    of a sandwich, fries and hot coffee. After giving the order, Mr. Turner drove up to
                                    the window and handed a 100 dollars
                                    worth of bills in one hand and 78 cents on the other hand, as payment to exchange
                                    with the robot. The robot detected the
                                    hand and began delivering the large order of coffees to Mr. Turner. With his hand
                                    full, Mr. Turner was unable to hold
                                    the meal and this resulted in the hot coffee spilling on him, causing third-degree
                                    burns.</p>
                                <p>The plaintiff Ethan Turner, who suffered third-degree burns at the receiving end of
                                    the miscalculation, insinuated from
                                    the automated drive-thru robot, is suing the defendant MacRonalds on the grounds of
                                    Negligence and is demanding a
                                    preliminary injunction on further usage of the robot until advancement in the
                                    technology is made. Furthermore, he is
                                    seeking payment for the accrued hospital bills for the damages he suffered. The
                                    defendant must disprove the negligence
                                    allegations and show that the plaintiff had violated contributory negligence.

                                    Contributory Negligence have 5 sub-elements that must be proved as outlined in the
                                    Virginia statute. However,
                                    contributory negligence under Virginia law follows the doctrine of pure contributory
                                    negligence which means that if the
                                    plaintiff is even so much as one percent at fault, he/she will have no case. Given

                                                The case handles the legal element of negligence, specifically the
                                                sub-element duty. In the case, the defendant had
                                                failed to demonstrate their duty of maintaining their parking lot in a
                                                safe condition. The plaintiff had suffered an
                                                assault on the defendant’s parking lot and the court found the defendant
                                                had a duty to maintain that safety for the
                                                people paying for that service.

                                                The case would help the plaintiff if they can prove the defendant did
                                                not demonstrate a duty to make sure their own
                                                customers are safe on their own property. The defendant has a duty to
                                                make sure their establishment and any services, in
                                                this case, the robot is safe for their customers.

                                                sub-element breach. The plaintiff, who was a

                                                falls under the company. The company had demonstrated negligence by

                                                safe.

                                                The case corresponds to the legal element of negligence and the
                                                sub-element of damages in particular. The plaintiff had
                                                suffered damages from flooding that occurred on the tenant’s property
                                                and proved the injuries received were caused by
                                                the defendant.

                                                act of negligence was the cause of any damages
                                                or injuries the plaintiff received.

                                                specifically the sub-element duty. It demonstrated that
                                                the plaintiff had taken caution when near a snowbank to prove they were
                                                not contributory negligent and that the
                                                defendant instead was held responsible.

                                                the road when they collided. However, the court
                                                ruled the case in favor of the defendant, where the defendant was shown
                                                to demonstrate contributory negligence for not
                                                maintaining proper distance.

                                                This case would help the defendant demonstrate that the plaintiff cannot
                                                simply claim negligence without proper
                                                evidence. If the plaintiff cannot prove that they had absolutely zero
                                                responsibility involved, it can be ruled in the
                                                defendant’s favor.

                                    <p>Ethan Turner is a recent graduate at Eastview University of Virginia (EUV) with a
                                        Bachelor of Science degree in
                                        Management with a measly 2.7 GPA. He is extremely charismatic and quite the
                                        party animal. Probably the most popular
                                        student at EUV and was the president of the fraternity Alpha Beta Chi (ABC).
                                        Currently unemployed, Ethan has a plentiful
                                        amount of time on his hands, where he spends most of his days partying with his
                                        friends and playing video games. He is a
                                        charming and friendly individual but is lazy and does not care for productivity.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The day of the incident started in a routine manner for Ethan. He went by the
                                        grocery store to gather cups, plates, etc.
                                        in preparation for a party that evening. Invited the usual crowd to swing by his
                                        apartment and the evening was set for
                                        hopefully another great party scene. As the party began to take shape, he became
                                        increasingly frustrated that the party
                                        was not exciting enough. Being the experienced individual he was during these
                                        circumstances, he offered to make food and
                                        coffee run to the local MacRonalds to which was followed by a roaring
                                        acclamation. On that note, he swiftly made his way
                                        to the MacRonalds drive-thru and was not aware of the newly installed, automated
                                        drive-thru robot. Although there were
                                        indirect warnings of the dangers that may be encountered, a direct warning was
                                        yet to be issued. He ordered 10 meals of
                                        a standard sandwich, fries, and a hot coffee which came to a total of $89.78.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Ethan finally pulls up to the drive-thru robot and extends a hundred dollars
                                        worth of bills in one hand and 78 cents in
                                        the other hand to pay for his meal so he does not receive any coins back in
                                        change. Realizing too late that the robot
                                        has failed to acknowledge the payment, the robot has begun delivering Ethan’s
                                        large order coffees. With no hands
                                        available, Ethan cannot grab the coffee in a reasonable fashion and the coffee
                                        inevitably spills all over him. After
                                        suffering third-degree burns and agonizing over it for the next couple of days,
                                        he finds a lawyer to sue MacRonalds as
                                        he is appalled that MacRonalds would approve such a dangerous machine that
                                        failed to complete a standard transaction
                                        that occurs in the process of a drive-thru.

                                <li>
                                    <p>Babbu Singh is a Punjabi American Citizen, who immigrated from New Delhi, India.
                                        He is currently a charcoal based
                                        artist, specializing in drawings. Babbu prides himself on breaking out from the
                                        traditional mold of occupations, and
                                        find happiness through drawing. He has been drawing since he was a child, and it
                                        is something that has come naturally to
                                        him. He doesn’t make a luxurious living however, but that’s not his focus. As
                                        long as he likes what he’s doing, and can
                                        live comfortably on that, he is satisfied.</p>
                                    <p>Ethan had met Babbu at Eastview University Virginia, where they both went to
                                        school together. Ethan and Babbu are now
                                        close friends and roommates, having shared a two bedroom apartment together for
                                        4 years, and continuing. It’s safe to
                                        say, Babbu understands the character of Ethan Turner.</p>
                                    <p>On the night of the incident, Babbu and Ethan threw a party at their small
                                        apartment. The party included karaoke,
                                        dancing, and typical party games. Babbu was having a great time at the party.
                                        Close to the end of the Party, everyone
                                        was sitting down and talking, as the energy in the party started to simmer down.
                                        Babbu noticed Ethan was a little
                                        irritated from the deflating party and saw him get up from the couch. He told
                                        everyone he was going to go to MacRonalds
                                        to get some food for everyone, and coffee’s to energize theme. Babbu and
                                        everyone gave Ethan their order.</p>
                                    <p>Knowing Ethan for many years, Babbu knows Ethan loves making sure other people
                                        have a great time. Ever since the
                                        incident of Ethan’s brother, Babbu has seen Ethan trying really hard to make
                                        sure he spends quality time around his
                                        loved ones. Babbu knows Ethan deeply missed his brother, who passed away
                                        recently.</p>
                                    <p>Unusually hours later from when Ethan left, Babbu received a call from their
                                        closest hospital, as Babbu is Ethan’s
                                        emergency contact. Upon arrival at the hospital, Babbu was informed of Ethan’s
                                        gruesome 3rd-degree burns. Babbu could
                                        not ever bear to look at the injuries, due to the severity of the burns. Babbu
                                        stayed by Ethan’s side during his stay at
                                        the hospital.</p>
                                    <p>Babbu is a regular customer of MacRonalds, but has never experienced the Robot
                                        cashier before. Before the cashier, Babbu
                                        has never had one accident occur to the degree of Ethan’s. Babbu loves talking
                                        and meeting with the drive-thru workers
                                        and misses them.</p>

                                                notice Ethan's trouble putting on his shoes.
                                                Babbu thinks he might have consumed too much alcohol, but believes he
                                                had a
                                                “safe” amount. Ethan has been sad because of
                                                the recent passing of his brother, which was due to driving under the

                                                his loved ones. He was simply trying to better the
                                                day of others when the robot decided to turn his entire day around. This
                                                could serve as a source of empathy for Ethan in

                                                Babbu saw Ethan a little irritated from the deflating party. Ethan was
                                                in a rush to get the food, it could have been a

                                    <p>The plaintiff, Ethan Turner, ultimately wants the defendant, MacRonalds, to be
                                        held liable for negligence. In order for
                                        Ethan to win the case, he must demonstrate that MacRonalds failed to meet all
                                        five sub-elements of negligence.</p>
                                    <p>John Scott, the CEO of MacRonalds, loves to incorporate the latest technology
                                        into his company whenever he can. This
                                        time, their software development team had come up with a new self-serve
                                        drive-thru robot and had finally finished the
                                        development of the project. Ethan, who happened to visit a location that had
                                        incorporated one of the new robots ended up
                                        in an incident where the robot failed to acknowledge the payment and resulted in
                                        spilling hot coffee all over him
                                        leading to third-degree burns.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The first sub-element that Ethan would have to prove the defendant did not meet
                                        would be the duty. MacRonalds has a duty
                                        to maintain proper safety for all their customers on their establishments. This
                                        includes the physical location from
                                        making sure the customers can walk safely in their restaurants to any
                                        service/machinery such as the drink machine to
                                        make sure they function properly for their customers. In this case, this would
                                        include drive-thru robots as well.
                                        MacDonalds had a duty to make sure that the robots would be safe for the
                                        customers to use. Ethan would have to prove
                                        that MacRonalds failed to demonstrate they held their duty of making sure the
                                        robots would be safe for public use.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The next sub-element involves the idea of the breach, to consider whether
                                        MacRonalds had breached their duty to ensure
                                        their robots would meet the standards to be used. Ethan would have to prove that
                                        MacRonalds had, in fact, breached the
                                        duty. This could include finding out that the robots had not gone through proper
                                        testing before being distributed for
                                        use in their establishments. If MacRonalds cannot prove that the robots had gone
                                        through sufficient training/testing, it
                                        would demonstrate they had indeed breached their duty to maintain a safe
                                        environment for their customers.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Ethan would also have to prove the sub-element causation, where the breach of
                                        duty from the defendant directly led to
                                        the cause of another’s injury or damages. For instance, improper testing on the
                                        robots could lead to faulty or buggy
                                        situations where the robots give unclear instructions to the customer. This
                                        could lead to confusion where the customer
                                        may be unsure of how to act and ultimately lead to an accident caused by the
                                        robot. Ethan would have to prove that the
                                        robot had in fact made some kind of error that caused the incident where the
                                        robot had spilled the coffee over Ethan.</p>
                                    <p>In addition, the next sub-element is proximate cause of the injury or damages
                                        where the defendant should have known that
                                        their breach would cause an injury or damage to another. When MacRonalds decided
                                        to distribute robots that had not gone
                                        through proper training, at that moment they clearly knew the robots are being
                                        placed in a setting where they could
                                        bring harm to the customers. Ethan would have to prove that MacRonalds knowingly
                                        and willingly made the decision to use
                                        the robots in their establishments despite them not all being completely tested.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Lastly, Ethan has to prove that he had suffered some sort of actual injury or
                                        damage as a result of the defendant. If
                                        the injury Ethan had received was a result of his own actions, he would not be
                                        able to support this sub-element. In this
                                        case, Ethan would simply have to demonstrate that the robot had directly caused
                                        the injuries he received from the
                                        incident. For example, to clearly prove that it was the robot’s action fault and
                                        not his own that led to the moment when
                                        the coffee was spilled on him.</p>

                                    <h5>Cases that Support the Plaintiff:</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        There are a number of cases that would support the plaintiff in this specific
                                        case. The first one is Wright v. Webb
                                        which primarily focused on the fact that an owner of an establishment is held
                                        responsible to make sure their location is
                                        safe for people to use it. Similarly to Ethan’s case, MacRonalds has a duty to
                                        ensure that their establishments are safe
                                        for their customers to use. This case has been cited 67 times with only
                                        positive, neutral and caution marks indicating
                                        that the case should be safe to use but to also proceed with caution.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The next case is Smith v. Norfolk & W. Ry. where it involves the legal element
                                        of negligence as well with an emphasis on
                                        breach of duty. In the case, the plaintiff had proved the defendant, a railway
                                        company, had breached their duty of
                                        keeping their customers safe and won the case. This scenario is similar to
                                        Ethan’s case where he would want to prove
                                        that MacRonalds had breached their duty to keep their customers safe as well.
                                        The precedent set by this case is
                                        substantial, as it had been stated in 13 other cases where it was a deciding
                                        factor for many of them as well.

                                        Another case in favor of the plaintiff is Shiflett.v. M. Timberlake, Inc. which
                                        involved a situation where the plaintiff
                                        suffered an injury from a result from the defendant not mopping their floors
                                        properly. It is helpful for the plaintiff
                                        because it is always the responsibility of the owner to ensure their store does
                                        not have any potential hazards for their
                                        customers. The case had been cited by 29 times with a number of positive and
                                        neutral marks indicating that while the
                                        case may be helpful for the plaintiff, there should be a level of caution and
                                        that it may not be the best option.

                                        One more case that could support the plaintiff’s side is Carolina, C. & O. R.
                                        Co. v. Mullins, which is similar to
                                        Ethan’s case in that it focuses on the damages or injuries suffered by the
                                        plaintiff. The case demonstrated that a
                                        result of the defendant’s actions led to direct injuries to the plaintiff, which
                                        is exactly what Ethan would want to
                                        prove and demonstrate in his case. The current precedential status of the case
                                        indicates positive treatment and that it
                                        should prove beneficial for the plaintiff.

                                        The last case that would be helpful for the plaintiff is Artrip v. E.E. Berry
                                        Equip. Co. where the plaintiff of the case
                                        had proven that they demonstrated caution in a potentially dangerous setting.
                                        It’s crucial for the plaintiff to prove
                                        that was had absolutely zero responsibility. Otherwise, the court could find the
                                        plaintiff responsible under
                                        contributory negligence which is what Ethan would want to avoid. The case’s
                                        current precedential status is indicated as
                                        positive treatment, where it had been cited in 75 other decisions with no
                                        questionable marks implying it would be a good
                                        case for the plaintiff.

                                    <p>The defendant, MacRonalds, ultimately wants the plaintiff, Turner, to be held
                                        liable for contributory negligence. In
                                        order for MacRonalds to win the case, he must demonstrate even so much as one
                                        percent that it was Turner's own fault for
                                        the injuries sustained.</p>
                                    <p>Ethan Turner, the victimized customer, loves to make other people happy and
                                        ensure they're having a good time. Turner
                                        happened to have come up across a newly implemented self-serve drive-thru robot
                                        made by Macronalds under the influence
                                        of alcohol where the robot was ready to hand him his order resulting in spilling
                                        hot coffee all over him leading to
                                        third-degree burns.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The one and only sub-element that MacRonalds would have to prove is the
                                        fulfillment of duty. Macronalds would have to
                                        prove this by showing that they have completed all the care necessary to provide
                                        safety to their customers. Furthermore,
                                        Macronalds can also prove that Turner is at least one percent responsible for
                                        the cause of his injuries by showing that
                                        he failed to follow the instructions given through indirect warnings available
                                        such as signs and brochures readily
                                        available for any potential user of the drive-thru. Lastly, Macronalds knows
                                        that Turner consumed alcohol that day,
                                        which can help towards proving contributory negligence because Turner had a lack
                                        of awareness while using the
                                        drive-thru.</p>

                                    <h5>Cases that Support the Defendant:</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        There are three cases, in particular, that would support the defendant in this
                                        specific case. The first one is Atlantic
                                        Rural Exposition, Inc. v. Fagan, 195 Va. 13, where its focus is placed on
                                        negligence, with breach as the sub-element.
                                        The case involves an injury sustained by the plaintiff involving a car accident.
                                        However, it was found that the
                                        inspections made prior to the vehicle's release were reasonable and that the car
                                        was safe to use. This scenario is
                                        similar to MacRonald's case where they went through several unique tests before
                                        releasing it to the public. This case
                                        has a high precedence given that it has a high shepherd's score and having taken
                                        place in the Virginia Supreme Court.
                                        Its precedent is overall Virginia cases not dealing with the federal
                                        constitution.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The next case is Norfolk & W.R. Co. v. Emmert, 83 Va. 640, where its focus is
                                        also on negligence, but on the
                                        sub-element, causation in particular. The case involves an injury sustained by
                                        the plaintiff because of a defective
                                        caboose bumper. However, it was found that the plaintiff failed to pay attention
                                        to details. Similarly to Macronalds
                                        case, Turner failed to read the indirect warnings provided through signs and
                                        brochures readily available to the user of
                                        the drive-thru. This case has two citing decisions is cited by two other cases.

                                        The last case is Litchford v. Hancock, 232 Va. 496, where its focus is on
                                        contributory negligence, specifically the
                                        sub-element duty. The case involves a motor collision. However, the court ruled
                                        in favor of the defendant because the
                                        plaintiff demonstrated contributory negligence for not maintaining proper
                                        distance. This scenario is similar to
                                        MacRonald's case in that Turner consumed alcohol that day. This case has been in
                                        47 citing decisions as well as being
                                        indicated as having a positive treatment with no question marks.

                                                Upon researching the various cases that handled the different
                                                sub-elements of negligence, despite the plaintiff being
                                                required to prove all the sub-elements of negligence, there were a large
                                                number of cases where the plaintiff was in fact
                                                successful. However, given that our case is in Virginia, the defendant
                                                has an easier job of only needing to prove one
                                                sub-element under contributory negligence. In fact, there were plenty of
                                                cases that were overturned undergrounds of
                                                contributory negligence. On top of the defendant being required to only
                                                prove a single sub-element to claim contributory
                                                negligence against the opposing party, it can go a step further in that
                                                if they can prove the plaintiff was found
                                                responsible for even 1%, the case can be overturned.

                                            <p>
                                                The key factor in determining which side of the case will be likely to
                                                win lies in the secret information. While it may
                                                seem easier for the defendant to overturn the case under claims of
                                                contributory negligence, the given facts of the case
                                                will clearly prove that the plaintiff did as they were supposed to.
                                                However, the secret information regarding the
                                                plaintiff will show that they actually might hold some responsibility as
                                                they had indulged in some alcoholic beverages
                                                prior to the incident. Ethan potentially not being completely sober
                                                before driving to the restaurant could lead to
                                                instances of not being properly able to follow the robot’s instructions
                                                or delayed actions which in turn would have led
                                                to the actual accident. If the defendant can prove that Ethan had been
                                                drinking prior, that could completely turn the
                                                case in favor of the defendant. On the plaintiff’s side, Ethan would
                                                have to prove all the sub-elements of negligence
                                                which could seem difficult at first glance. However, one piece of
                                                crucial secret information is the fact that MacRonalds
                                                had rushed the distribution of the robots without proper testing. That
                                                one fact alone would help prove multiple
                                                sub-elements and greatly turn the tide of the case in favor of the
                                                plaintiff.

                                                To deal with imbalance, we will simply add or remove facts to the case
                                                to maintain a balance in the deciding factors of
                                                the case. For example, to prove a “breach of duty”, we must add facts
                                                that MacRonalds performed reasonable testing, so
                                                therefore according to the case law mentioned above, MacRonalds
                                                shouldn’t be held liable for negligence. This is a
                                                situation where we needed to add short facts of MacRonalds testing the
                                                drive-thru robot. These facts are subtle but can
                                                be beneficial towards balancing both sides of the case. It is clear that
                                                the defendant has a slight edge in terms of the
                                                balance of law. In order to give the plaintiff a stronger argument and
                                                chance at winning, additional secretive
                                                information will be included for the full witness statements that would
                                                not be easy for the defendants to uncover. The
                                                scenario would have the plaintiff following all the elements under
                                                negligence, so the defendant would have a tougher
                                                time trying to claim contributory negligence. This adds potentially
                                                alternative ways for both the plaintiff and
                                                defendant to have a chance at winning the case.
