                                <p>Ethan Turner, a customer of MacRonalds, is suing MacRonalds, for the injuries
                                    suffered
                                    from the accident that occurred
                                    in the drive-thru. Mr. Turner wants MacRonalds to remove their robot services from
                                    the
                                    drive-thru until the bugs are
                                    fixed.</p>
                                <p>MacRonalds, a fast food chain, has recently come up with a new way to serve
                                    drive-thru
                                    items with robots. Ethan Turner,
                                    a customer who wanted to try out the new technology, visited MacRonalds and ordered
                                    a
                                    sandwich, fries and hot coffee.
                                    After giving the order, Mr. Turner drove up to the window and handed a 20-dollar
                                    bill as
                                    payment to the robot. The robot
                                    detected the hand and extended Mr. Turner the meal with the hot coffee. With his
                                    hand
                                    full, Mr. Turner was unable to
                                    hold the meal and this resulted to the hot coffee spilling on him, causing
                                    second-degree
                                    burns.</p>
                                <p>Since MacRonalds new technology had bugs, and was not safe to be in service, Mr.
                                    Turner
                                    strongly believes that this
                                    service should be removed until all the bugs are fixed and it is safe to be used.
                                    Mr.
                                    Turner is suing MacRonalds for the
                                    defect in the system which caused a second-degree burn on his hand. On the contrary,
                                    MacRonalds wants to defend its new
                                    technology by proving the contributory negligence of Mr. Turner, the plaintiff.</p>

                                    The plaintiff Ethan Turner,
                                    who suffered third-degree burns at the receiving end of the miscalculation,
                                    insinuated
                                    from the automated drive-thru
                                    robot, is suing the defendant MacRonalds on the grounds of Negligence and is
                                    demanding a
                                    preliminary injunction on
                                    further usage of the robot until advancement in the technology is made. The
                                    defendant
                                    must disprove the negligence
                                    allegations and show that the plaintiff had violated contributory negligence. Both
                                    Negligence and Contributory
                                    Negligence have 5 sub-elements that must be proved as outlined in the Virginia
                                    statute.
                                    However, contributory negligence
                                    under Virginia law follows the doctrine of pure contributory negligence which means
                                    that
                                    if the plaintiff is even so
                                    much as one percent at fault, he/she will have no case. As an effective means to
                                    distribute the workload of the team and
                                    the balance of the law for contributory negligence, only one statute will be
                                    covered,

                                drive-thru. He claims that his third-degree burns came from the fault of the drive-thru
                                robot. He is appalled at
                                MacRonalds’ approval of a dangerous machine that failed to complete a standard

                                    in particular discussed the matter where a homeowner was presented with the

                                    failed to show this, but can be
