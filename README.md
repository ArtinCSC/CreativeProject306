# Section 1 – Summary

TechFix v. FixTechSolutions (Case name)

The technology repair company TechFix (www.techfix.com) is suing their competitor, FixTechSolutions (www.fixtechsolutions.com), for lost revenue and clientele due to similarities in their domain names.

(In a single sentence: Who are the parties? Who is suing whom? What does the plaintiff want?)

 

TechFix was first established in 1998 while FixTechSolutions has only been around for 2 years. A year ago, FixTechSolutions was known as TechnologySolutions. A new investor, Michael Money, convinced the founders to rebrand in hopes of refreshing the company’s image and bringing in new customers.

(What events occurred to cause the controversy in question? What background information is relevant to the case?)

 

Since FixTechSolutions changed its name and obtained a corresponding domain name, they have gotten significantly more search hits and computer repair requests. Meanwhile, TechFix has seen a decline in both these areas. The plaintiff believes that because they experienced this decline around the time FixTechSolutions obtained their domain name, the defendants are responsible.

(Why does the plaintiff feel justified in bringing the case to court?)

 

Due to the similarity in names, TechFix is suing under the Anti-cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) of 1999. TechFix believes that Michael Money knew that consumers would think that techfix.com and fixtechsolutions.com belonged to the same company due to the similarity in names, thereby intentionally redirecting the TechFix traffic to the FixTechSolutions website instead. TechFix is seeking financial compensation due to the loss of business; TechFix also seeks to bar FixTechSolutions from continued use of the domain name fixtechsolutions.com.

# Section 2 – Legal Basis or Foundation

Legal Authority

One case that provides legal precedent is JACK IN THE BOX, INC., Plaintiff, v. JACKINTHEBOX.ORG, and JACKINTHEBOX.NET, Defendants. In this case, the court found that the JACKINTHEBOX.ORG and JACKINTHEBOX.NET domain names violated the ACPA because there was "no question that the domain names were registered and would have led to confusion, mistake, or deception of the plaintiff’s mark and the names were exact replicas of the plaintiff’s mark." Therefore, the court ruled that the defendants’ domain names must be handed over to JACK IN THE BOX, INC.

(What case or cases can establish legal precedent for the plaintiff? What was the outcome?)

Similarly, in the case of TechFix v FixTechSolutions, the FixTechSolutions.com domain name could easily be confused with the TechFix.com domain name. Therefore, it could be argued that this could cause "confusion, mistake, or deception of the plaintiff’s mark."

(How does this case establish legal precedent for the plaintiff?)

 

 Legal Elements

Anti-cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) (5 U.S.C. § 1125(d)). To constitute cybersquatting, basic conditions must be met to satisfy the statute:

a) Bad Faith Intent – a domain name chosen that has

1. Intellectual property rights in the domain name

2. High consistency of the legal name to the domain name

3. The prior use of the domain name

4. The intent to divert consumers to the other domain name

b) Registration of a domain name that is

1. Identical or confusingly similar to the "distinctive mark"

2. Identical or confusingly similar to or dilutive of a famous mark

3. A trademark protected by 18 U.S.C. 706 or 36 U.S.C. 220506

(What specific elements of the statute pertain to the plaintiff’s case?)

 

# Part 3 - Balance of Law and Facts

Plaintiff’s Argument

The plaintiff, TechFix, argues that FixTechSolutions’ investor, Michael Money, is a marketing tools expert. His previous investing experience demonstrates that his actions to rebrand the fledgling company with a name that could be easily confused with a mature and successful company might have had malicious intent. TechFix argues that Mr. Money intended to benefit from the confusion created by the similarity in names, and that this confusion would lead to better business for FixTechSolutions. TechFix believes that the diversion of customers from their website to that of the defendants is responsible for the decline in business the plaintiff experienced around the time that the FixTechSolutions domain was registered.

(What are the facts of the case, as told by the plaintiff?)

 

Defendant’s Argument

The defendant, FixTechSolutions, views the similarities in name as a coincidence. Michael Money, who suggested the name, just wanted to add the word "fix" to the name. The reason for the name change was to clarify for potential customers that FixTechSolutions’ primary trade is the repair of computers, not other computer-related services. In JACKINTHEBOX, INC. v. JACKINTHEBOX.ORG, the ruling was based on the names being exact replicas of the plaintiff's trademark. However, in this case, the ordering of the words is different, so the defendants argue that they are not exactly the same and, therefore, not confusing for a reasonable person. Lastly, FixTechSolutions adds that TechFix cannot possibly blame the similarity in domain name for losses in profits. The defendants submit that TechFix may have experienced problems with their quality of service due to a change of leadership in their organization around the time of the reported losses.

# Part 4 – Scenario Justification

Present Relevance

As computer science majors, website design, development, and administration are all potential fields of employment. Familiarity with cases citing statute from the Anti-cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) would be good preparation for people seeking out those specialties.

(Why is this case relevant to current CS 306 students?)

 

Future Relevance

This case could be valuable for a future mock trial, since both sides have strong arguments for their case. The winner is not at all clear, based on the arguments put forth by the plaintiff and the defendant. Furthermore, it highlights the gray area around computer science-related ethics and laws, as well as demonstrating that rulings can vary greatly depending on how these kinds of cases are argued.

(Why is this case valuable for future CS 306 students?)

 

Difference in Application (When applicable)

Although [current mock trial] cites the ACPA in [Plaintiff] v. [Defendant], that case primarily focuses on the intentional deception on part of the defendant. [Plaintiff] brought forth evidence that [Defendant] planned to drive web traffic from [Plaintiff’s website] to [Defendant’s website]. [Defendant] claims that [Plaintiff] illegally obtained said evidence, and further claims that their intent was to parody [Plaintiff’s website].

(How is this case a different application of the statute than that cited in [current mock trial]?)
