                                <p>Ethan Turner, a customer of MacRonalds, is suing MacRonalds, for the injuries
                                    suffered from the accident that occurred
                                    in the drive-thru. Mr. Turner wants MacRonalds to remove their robot services from
                                    the drive-thru until the bugs are
                                    fixed. MacRonalds, a fast food chain, has recently come up with a new way to serve
                                    drive-thru items with robots. The
                                    robot is designed with a built-in-hand that grips on to food and releases when the
                                    customer has a hold on to the food.
                                    As customers drive up to the drive-thru window, they can see a manual that lets them
                                    know how the robot operates. First,
                                    customers give the order and the robot repeats the order to make sure it entered the
                                    order correctly with the total
                                    cost. Secondly, it asks the customers to drive up to the register window where they
                                    will pay and get their order. The
                                    robot announces “Caution! Handing the order! Prepare to receive it.” and hands, the
                                    customer, their food. Finally, the
                                    robot receives the payment for the food from the customer and returns change if any.
                                </p>
                                <p>Ethan Turner, a customer who wanted to get some food for his friends, visited
                                    MacRonalds and ordered 10 meals that
                                    consisted of a sandwich, fries and hot coffee. After giving the order, Mr. Turner
                                    drove up to the window and handed a
                                    100 dollars worth of bills in one hand and 78 cents on the other hand, as payment to
                                    exchange with the robot. The robot
                                    announced that it was delivering the food and as it detected Ethan’s hand, it began
                                    delivering the large order of
                                    coffees to Mr. Turner. With his hand full, Mr. Turner was unable to hold the meal
                                    and this resulted in the hot coffee
                                    spilling on him, causing second-degree burns. The plaintiff Ethan Turner, who
                                    suffered second-degree burns at the
                                    receiving end of the miscalculation, insinuated from the automated drive-thru robot,
                                    is suing the defendant MacRonalds
                                    on the grounds of Negligence and is demanding a preliminary injunction on further
                                    usage of the robot until advancement
                                    in the technology is made. Furthermore, he is seeking payment for the accrued
                                    hospital bills for the damages he
                                    suffered. The defendant must disprove the negligence allegations and show that the
                                    plaintiff had violated contributory
                                    negligence.

                                <p>This particular case involves the victim Ethan Turner and the fast-food mogul
                                    MacRonalds. Both Negligence and
                                    Contributory Negligence have 5 sub-elements that must be proved as outlined in the
                                    Virginia statute. However,
                                    contributory negligence under Virginia law follows the doctrine of pure contributory
                                    negligence which means that if the
                                    plaintiff is even so much as one percent at fault, he/she will have no case. Given
                                    the overwhelming influence of
                                    contributory negligence in Virginia, Only the Duty statute will be expanded upon.

                                                sub-element duty. In the case, the defendant had
                                                failed to demonstrate their duty of maintaining their parking lot in a
                                                safe condition. The plaintiff had suffered an
                                                assault on the defendant’s parking lot and the court found the defendant
                                                had a duty to maintain that safety for the

                                                The case would help the plaintiff if they can prove the defendant did
                                                not demonstrate a duty to make sure their own
                                                customers are safe on their own property. The defendant has a duty to

                                                sub-element breach. The plaintiff, who was a
                                                passenger of a railway company, had assault and battery committed on
                                                them where the responsibility of the passengers
                                                falls under the company. The company had demonstrated negligence by
                                                breaching their duty of keeping their passengers
                                                safe.

                                                not contributory negligent and that the
                                                defendant instead was held responsible.

                                                The case involves the legal element of contributory negligence,
                                                specifically the sub-element duty. It involved a motor
                                                accident where the plaintiff had claimed the defendant was negligent on
                                                the road when they collided. However, the court
                                                ruled the case in favor of the defendant, where the defendant was shown
                                                to demonstrate contributory negligence for not
                                                maintaining proper distance.

                                            <p>
                                                This case would help the defendant demonstrate that the plaintiff cannot
                                                simply claim negligence without proper
                                                evidence. If the plaintiff cannot prove that they had absolutely zero
                                                responsibility involved, it can be ruled in the
                                                defendant’s favor.

                                            the drive-thru robot. He is appalled at

                                has an interesting and easy to follow
                                scenario, which involved two legal elements, Negligence, and contributorily
                                negligence. These two laws are interesting
                                as they present a complex scenario that can be easily misconstrued, especially
                                in the state of Virginia. The submitted
                                mock trial also provides a creative and meticulously woven list of witness
                                statements, which can be used for the
                                witnesses on the mock trial to have a clear picture of characters of the
                                scenario. In addition, there is some helpful
                                information for both the defendant and plaintiff, which again will help the mock
                                trial team, lawyers and witnesses, to
                                have a clear picture of the case as well as finding a way to win the case. the
                                case is balanced enough that basically,
                                it is up to the lawyers on how to approach the case in order to win.
