                                        <p>We changed some features in the robot design. In our third part of the
                                            project, the
                                            robot description was vague and
                                            general. We have updated the robot design to have human-like-hands to
                                            perform the
                                            transaction in the drive-thru window
                                            just like a human being. The updated robot system also gives the customers,
                                            set of
                                            instruction before they drive up to
                                            the window. The robot functions with a set of instruction:

                                            During our questionnaire portion of the presentation, we got various
                                            questions about the robot and its design detail.
                                            This motivated us to improve the robot details and update the form of order

                                            Improvement in robot design gives a good structure and validity to the case.
                                            With the knowledge of how the robot is
                                            designed and how it functions, we create a liability on the plaintiff’s
                                            (Ethan) side and balances the two sides. The new
                                            set of instructions that we updated allows the reader to understand exactly
                                            how the robot functions and therefore they
                                            can follow the case easily. Changing the robot instructions to announce
                                            before handing food increases the validity of
                                            the defendant’s case.

                                            character of Ethan Turner. The largest change that
                                            needed to be made was the fact that he had been originally consuming
                                            alcohol. This was transitioned to make him sleepy
                                            to lighten the criminalization of Ethan. Furthermore, the various demeanor
                                            aspects of the character were changed to
                                            something more suited to a person who may be sleepy from time to time.
                                            Secret information was modified to conform to the
                                            new story of Ethan. The long hours of a restaurant shift can make anybody
                                            tired and will surely make the case a little
                                            more interesting than originally planned.

                                            The change that prompted everything for Ethan was delivered by the UTA.
                                            Shortly after, our classmates had followed with
                                            this observation as alcohol would certainly be a bit too incriminating to
                                            Ethan which unbalances the case significantly
                                            if it were to be discovered. The simple notion of changing Ethan’s main vice
                                            from alcohol to sleep prompted a long chain
                                            of elements to be changed within the description of Ethan, as detailed in
                                            the previous subsection.

                                            This change will make the case more balanced from before, even upon the
                                            discovery that he may have been too sleepy to be
                                            driving. It is not illegal to work long hours, not get enough sleep, and
                                            drive while being drowsy. With the balance of
                                            the law intact, it will really come down to the moral compass of the jury
                                            should the information be discovered. Even if
                                            this is uncovered, the defendant’s secret information should counteract any
                                            negative connotations that this information
                                            might indicate. It will come down to the due diligence of the mock-trial
                                            lawyers.

                                            The portion at focus here is Babbu Singh regarding his detailed and
                                            summarized plaintiff witness. The changes were less
                                            about the character of Babbu and more about his interactions with Ethan.
                                            Babbu previously was a key factor in helping
                                            discover the secret information of Ethan being slightly intoxicated. This
                                            was changed so that Ethan would be sleepy
                                            while driving. Babbu’s dialogue was also changed to give the defense counsel
                                            a definitive fact that they could use to
                                            show Ethan was clearly sleepy. All information relating to alcohol was
                                            replaced with sleep deprivation. Lastly, the
                                            secret information was changed to be more significant to the case.

                                            The UTA was pivotal in helping us decide what Babbu’s role should play. The
                                            UTA stated that Ethan being intoxicated
                                            while driving was too bias towards one side the case, so she recommended we
                                            use sleep deprivation instead. Also, for the
                                            change in Babbu’s dialogue, that was prompted by the professor's comments to
                                            give information that was more definitive
                                            than a defense could pry out of a witness. Lastly, I was told by the
                                            feedback in the discussion board that Babbu’s role
                                            didn’t add much to the case, so I added in secret information to make this
                                            witness more significant to the case.

                                            Babbu Singh now serves as a more significant role to the case, as his
                                            experience at the party is integral to the
                                            defense's case. If a defense finds out Babbu has to repeat the question 5
                                            times to Ethan before he left to get Coffee’s,
                                            this shows that Ethan was clearly tired to drive. This definitive factual
                                            element is helpful in balancing the case by
                                            giving the defense a chance to charge Ethan with contributorily negligence,
                                            as his cognitive functions were clearly
                                            hindered by his sleep deprivation.

                                            This portion will outline the few, but crucial changes made to the character
                                            of John Scott. The most impactful change
                                            that needed to be made was the fact that he originally knew about Ethan
                                            being sleep deprived. This was transitioned to
                                            him not knowing about this at all as we removed John Scott out of the
                                            incident scene. Furthermore, the key factor we
                                            added is the threat to fire Jesse Smith if the drive-thru robot wasn’t
                                            released immediately before his business
                                            competitor. In addition, we added that John was aware that the robot was not
                                            yet ready to be released and that it needed
                                            a couple of more months to be bug-free.

                                            In our creative project part 3, the feedback we got suggested that our case
                                            was leaning more towards the defendant’s
                                            side and John Scott’s character needed another form of involvement instead
                                            of knowing about Ethan drinking.

                                            By altering John’s form of involvement in the case we omit the fact of him
                                            knowing anything about Ethan being sleep
                                            deprived and solely focus on his character as now being a threat to Jesse’s
                                            employment. More importantly however,
                                            because John rushes the release of the drive-thru robot, this now benefits
                                            the plaintiff side. Which, ultimately causes
                                            the case to be more balanced.

                                            background with information leading the readers to understand that he is a
                                            very reliable and respected person who always
                                            tries to produce the best products he can. We also included that the product
                                            was developed using Test Driven Development
                                            method. The updated detailed witness statement also discusses Mr. Smith’s
                                            and the CEO, John Scott’s relation.
                                            In the secret information of Jesse Smith’s witness statement, we clarified
                                            the fact that John Scott had threatened Jesse
                                            Smith to get the product ready to launch months ahead of due date which led
                                            Mr. Smith to pass some minor failed tests.

                                            third sub-element of negligence was changed for
                                            clarification. Prior to the change, the description was somewhat vague and
                                            did not clearly state what the plaintiff
                                            would have to prove for the sub-element of causation. There is now an actual

                                            done at the time of the accident. In addition, it helps to define what the
                                            actual sub-element is and how the defendant
                                            may have failed to meet the sub-element.

                                            The analysis of the defendant’s arguments had a number of issues that needed
                                            to be changed in conjunction with the
                                            modified witness statements. First, it was stated that Ethan had been
                                            drinking and potentially under the influence of
                                            alcohol at the incident. It was then decided that alcohol would tip the
                                            favor of the case too heavily to the defendant,
                                            so it was changed to a lack of sleep instead. The scenario section was
                                            changed to reflect that and now doesn’t mention
                                            the alcohol previously stated.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Another change was to generalize the statement regarding what the defendant
                                            would have to prove in order to win or
                                            overturn the case. Prior to the change, it was noted that they would
                                            specifically prove they upheld their duty of care
                                            to prove they were not negligent. However, it does not have to be that
                                            specific sub-element, but instead any of the
                                            elements. The analysis had also originally mentioned that MacRonald’s was
                                            aware of the fact that the plaintiff had
                                            consumed alcohol that day. We intended for the CEO of MacRonalds or an
                                            employee at the location to be present at the
                                            time of the incident, but it was changed so that it was just Ethan and the
                                            robot at the accident. The statement now
                                            mentions the possibility that Ethan could have not gotten enough sleep the
                                            night before.

                                            After the in-class presentation of our case, the instructor suggested the
                                            idea that the plaintiff could have had a lack
                                            of sleep rather than being under the influence. There were also a number of
                                            Blackboard comments mentioning how alcohol
                                            could potentially make it much more difficult for Ethan to win the case.

                                            The change from Ethan being under the influence to not getting proper sleep
                                            significantly helps balance the case.
                                            Whereas drinking and driving alone adds another potential crime to Ethan’s
                                            name, it is technically not illegal to drive
                                            without enough sleep. It also makes it harder for the defendant to acquire
                                            the information about Ethan and how much
                                            sleep he really had gotten or how much it affects him at all. The case was
                                            somewhat favored for the defendant, but the
                                            change helps balance it so the plaintiff has a better chance at winning the
                                            case now.

                                            The balance of laws had once again originally mentioned the fact that Ethan
                                            had indulged in alcoholic beverages that
                                            night. It was changed to instead state that Ethan had not gotten enough
                                            sleep the night before, as well as a few other
                                            additional details that further adds to that point. However, the
                                            implications of both situations are similar in that
                                            they could lead to delayed actions or failure to properly read the
                                            instructions from the robot completely, so that did
                                            not have to be changed. The overall scenario had also been changed so it
                                            would be even more difficult for the defendant
                                            to prove the lack of sleep from Ethan, so it was added to emphasize how
                                            important the information would be.

                                            The balance of the laws was always an issue for our case, so we had some
                                            trouble originally trying to make it less
                                            favorable for the defendant to win. The change for Ethan to simply have a
                                            lack of sleep rather than drinking alcoholic
                                            beverages the night of the incident greatly helps balance the overall case
                                            so the plaintiff has a stronger side.

                                        <p>The plaintiff, Ethan Turner, ultimately wants the defendant, MacRonalds, to
                                            be held liable for negligence. In order for
                                            Ethan to win the case, he must demonstrate that MacRonalds failed to meet
                                            all five sub-elements of negligence.</p>
                                        <p>John Scott, the CEO of MacRonalds, loves to incorporate the latest technology
                                            into his company whenever he can. This
                                            time, their software development team had come up with a new self-serve
                                            drive-thru robot and had finally finished the
                                            development of the project. Ethan, who happened to visit a location that had
                                            incorporated one of the new robots ended up
                                            in an incident where the robot failed to acknowledge the payment and
                                            resulted in spilling hot coffee all over him
                                            leading to second-degree burns.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The first sub-element that Ethan would have to prove the defendant did not
                                            meet would be the duty. MacRonalds has a duty
                                            to maintain proper safety for all their customers on their establishments.
                                            This includes the physical location from
                                            making sure the customers can walk safely in their restaurants to any
                                            service/machinery such as the drink machine to
                                            make sure they function properly for their customers. In this case, this
                                            would include drive-thru robots as well.
                                            MacRonalds had a duty to make sure that the robots would be safe for the
                                            customers to use. Ethan would have to prove
                                            that MacRonalds failed to demonstrate they held their duty of making sure
                                            the robots would be safe for public use.

                                        <p>The next sub-element involves the idea of the breach, to consider whether
                                            MacRonalds had breached their duty to ensure
                                            their robots would meet the standards to be used. Ethan would have to prove
                                            that MacRonalds had, in fact, breached the
                                            duty. This could include finding out that the robots had not gone through
                                            proper testing before being distributed for
                                            use in their establishments. If MacRonalds cannot prove that the robots had
                                            gone through sufficient training/testing, it
                                            would demonstrate they had indeed breached their duty to maintain a safe
                                            environment for their customers.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Ethan would also have to prove the sub-element causation, where the breach of
                                            duty from the defendant directly led to
                                            the cause of another’s injury or damages. For instance, improper testing on
                                            the robots could lead to faulty or buggy
                                            situations where the robots give unclear instructions to the customer. For
                                            example, a visual or audio error from the
                                            robot where it instructed Ethan to do something, but could not respond
                                            accordingly when Ethan followed the instructions.
                                            More specifically, if the robot asks Ethan for payment, but ends up handing
                                            the coffee rather than accepting the
                                            payment, the robot would be at fault at that point.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, the next sub-element is the proximate cause of the injury or
                                            damages where the defendant should have known
                                            that their breach would cause an injury or damage to another. When
                                            MacRonalds decided to distribute robots that had not
                                            gone through proper training, at that moment they clearly knew the robots
                                            are being placed in a setting where they could
                                            bring harm to the customers. Ethan would have to prove that MacRonalds
                                            knowingly and willingly made the decision to use
                                            the robots in their establishments despite them not all being completely
                                            tested.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Lastly, Ethan has to prove that he had suffered some sort of actual injury or
                                            damage as a result of the defendant. If
                                            the injury Ethan had received was a result of his own actions, he would not
                                            be able to support this sub-element. In this
                                            case, Ethan would simply have to demonstrate that the robot had directly
                                            caused the injuries he received from the
                                            incident. For example, to clearly prove that it was the robot’s action fault
                                            and not his own that led to the moment when
                                            the coffee was spilled on him.

                                        <h5>Cases that Support the Plaintiff:</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            There are a number of cases that would support the plaintiff in this
                                            specific case. The first one is Wright v. Webb
                                            which primarily focused on the fact that an owner of an establishment is
                                            held responsible to make sure their location is
                                            safe for people to use it. Similarly to Ethan’s case, MacRonalds has a duty
                                            to ensure that their establishments are safe
                                            for their customers to use. This case has been cited 67 times with only
                                            positive, neutral and caution marks indicating
                                            that the case should be safe to use but to also proceed with caution.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The next case is Smith v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. where it involves the legal
                                            element of negligence as well with an emphasis on breach of duty. In the
                                            case, the
                                            plaintiff had proved the defendant, a railway company, had breached their
                                            duty of keeping their customers safe and won
                                            the case. This scenario is similar to Ethan’s case where he would want to
                                            prove that MacRonalds had breached their duty
                                            to keep their customers safe as well. The precedent set by this case is
                                            substantial, as it had been stated in 13 other
                                            cases where it was a deciding factor for many of them as well.

                                        <p>
                                            Another case in favor of the plaintiff is Shiflett.v. M. Timberlake, Inc.
                                            which involved a situation where the plaintiff
                                            suffered an injury from a result from the defendant not mopping their floors
                                            properly. It is helpful for the plaintiff
                                            because it is always the responsibility of the owner to ensure their store
                                            does not have any potential hazards for their
                                            customers. The case had been cited by 29 times with a number of positive and
                                            neutral marks indicating that while the
                                            case may be helpful for the plaintiff, there should be a level of caution
                                            and that it may not be the best option.

                                            One more case that could support the plaintiff’s side is Carolina, C. &amp;
                                            O. R. Co. v. Mullins, which is similar to Ethan’s case in that it focuses on
                                            the damages or injuries suffered by the
                                            plaintiff. The case demonstrated that a result of the defendant’s actions
                                            led to direct injuries to the plaintiff, which
                                            is exactly what Ethan would want to prove and demonstrate in his case. The
                                            current precedential status of the case
                                            indicates positive treatment and that it should prove beneficial for the
                                            plaintiff.

                                            The last case that would be helpful for the plaintiff is Artrip v. E.E.
                                            Berry Equip. Co. where the plaintiff of the case
                                            had proven that they demonstrated caution in a potentially dangerous
                                            setting. It’s crucial for the plaintiff to prove
                                            that was had absolutely zero responsibility. Otherwise, the court could find
                                            the plaintiff responsible under
                                            contributory negligence which is what Ethan would want to avoid. The case’s
                                            current precedential status is indicated as
                                            positive treatment, where it had been cited in 75 other decisions with no
                                            questionable marks implying it would be a good
                                            case for the plaintiff.

                                        <p>Detailed analysis of Defendant's arguments:
                                            The defendant, MacRonalds, ultimately wants the plaintiff, Turner, to be
                                            held liable for contributory negligence. In
                                            order for MacRonalds to win the case, they must demonstrate that Ethan was
                                            responsible for his own injuries at the time
                                            of the incident, even if it was only one percent.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Ethan Turner, the victimized customer, loves to make other people happy and
                                            ensure they're having a good time. Ethan,
                                            who wanted to bring up the mood of the party he was hosting offered to grab
                                            some MacRonalds for his guests. He
                                            encounters MacRonald’s brand new self-serve drive-thru robots for the first
                                            time where the robot ends up spilling hot
                                            coffee on his arm when trying to give it payment for his order.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Where the plaintiff would have to prove all five sub-elements of negligence,
                                            MacRonald’s would simply have to disprove
                                            one. For example, it could prove they upheld their duty of care regarding
                                            the incident, that alone would be enough to
                                            defeat that legal element. Macronalds could prove this by showing that they
                                            have completed all the care necessary to
                                            provide safety to their customers. Furthermore, Macronalds can also prove
                                            that Turner is at least one percent
                                            responsible for the cause of his injuries by showing that he failed to
                                            follow the instructions given through indirect
                                            warnings available such as signs and brochures readily available for any
                                            potential user of the drive-thru. There is also
                                            the possibility Ethan was not the best condition either physically or
                                            mentally that led to the actual accident. Possibly
                                            from a lack of sleep or other factors affecting his mental wellbeing. If
                                            MacRonald’s can prove these potential facts
                                            about Ethan, it could be proven that Ethan was in fact responsible somewhat
                                            for the incident.</p>

                                        <p>
                                            There are three cases, in particular, that would support the defendant in
                                            this specific case. The first one is Atlantic
                                            Rural Exposition, Inc. v. Fagan, 195 Va. 13, where its focus is placed on
                                            negligence, with the breach as the
                                            sub-element. The case involves an injury sustained by the plaintiff
                                            involving a car accident. However, it was found that
                                            the inspections made prior to the vehicle's release were reasonable and that
                                            the car was safe to use. This scenario is
                                            similar to MacRonald's case where they went through several unique tests
                                            before releasing it to the public. This case
                                            has high precedence given that it has a high shepherd's score and have taken
                                            place in the Virginia Supreme Court. Its
                                            precedent is overall Virginia cases not dealing with the federal
                                            constitution.

                                            The next case is Norfolk &amp; W.R. Co. v. Emmert, 83 Va. 640, where its
                                            focus is also on negligence, but on the sub-element, causation in
                                            particular.
                                            The case involves an injury sustained by the plaintiff because of a
                                            defective caboose bumper. However, it was found that
                                            the plaintiff failed to pay attention to details. Similarly to Macronalds
                                            case, Turner failed to read the indirect
                                            warnings provided through signs and brochures readily available to the user
                                            of the drive-thru. This case has two citing
                                            decisions is cited by two other cases.

                                            The last case is Litchford v. Hancock, 232 Va. 496, where its focus is on
                                            contributory negligence, specifically the
                                            sub-element duty. The case involves a motor collision. However, the court
                                            ruled in favor of the defendant because the
                                            plaintiff demonstrated contributory negligence for not maintaining a proper
                                            distance. This scenario is similar to
                                            MacRonald's case in that Turner consumed alcohol that day. This case has
                                            been in 47 citing decisions as well as being
                                            indicated as having a positive treatment with no question marks.

                                                    Upon researching the various cases that handled the different
                                                    sub-elements of negligence, despite the plaintiff being
                                                    required to prove all the sub-elements of negligence, there were a
                                                    large number of cases where the plaintiff was in fact
                                                    successful. However, given that our case is in Virginia, the
                                                    defendant has an easier job of only needing to prove one
                                                    sub-element under contributory negligence. In fact, there were
                                                    plenty of cases that were overturned on grounds of
                                                    contributory negligence. On top of the defendant being required to
                                                    only prove a single sub-element to claim contributory
                                                    negligence against the opposing party, it can go a step further in
                                                    that if they can prove the plaintiff was found
                                                    responsible for even 1%, the case can be overturned.

                                                <p>
                                                    The key factor in determining which side of the case will be likely
                                                    to win lies in the secret information. While it may
                                                    seem easier for the defendant to overturn the case under claims of
                                                    contributory negligence, the given facts of the case
                                                    will clearly prove that the plaintiff did as they were supposed to.
                                                    This includes following all the instructions given
                                                    by the robot from the first moment until the actual accident.
                                                    However, some secret information from the plaintiff’s side
                                                    would reveal that the plaintiff had not gotten enough sleep the
                                                    night before. On top of that, he had worked a long shift
                                                    at work which adds on to the fact that the plaintiff could have been
                                                    groggy at the time of the incident. This fact could
                                                    raise questions if the plaintiff had delayed actions during the time
                                                    of payment or potential failure to read the
                                                    instructions in complete detail from the robot. Since this piece of
                                                    information plays such a crucial role in overturning
                                                    the case, the witness statements were made so it would be difficult
                                                    for the defendant to acquire this information. On
                                                    the plaintiff’s side, Ethan would have to prove all the sub-elements
                                                    of negligence which could seem difficult at first
                                                    glance. However, one piece of crucial secret information is the fact
                                                    that MacRonalds had rushed the distribution of the
                                                    robots without proper testing. That one fact alone would help prove
                                                    multiple sub-elements and greatly turn the tide of
                                                    the case in favor of the plaintiff.

                                                    To deal with imbalance, we will simply add or remove facts to the
                                                    case to maintain a balance in the deciding factors of
                                                    the case. For example, to prove a “breach of duty”, we must add
                                                    facts that MacRonalds performed reasonable testing, so
                                                    therefore according to the case law mentioned above, MacRonalds
                                                    shouldn’t be held liable for negligence. This is a
                                                    situation where we needed to add short facts of MacRonalds testing
                                                    the drive-thru robot. These facts are subtle but can
                                                    be beneficial towards balancing both sides of the case. It is clear
                                                    that the defendant has a slight edge in terms of the
                                                    balance of the law. As a result, the witness statements make it so
                                                    there’s only one definite way for the defendant to
                                                    overturn the case which involves the fact that the plaintiff did not
                                                    get enough sleep the night before. On the other
                                                    hand, the plaintiff would have a few potential ways to prove the
                                                    legal elements of negligence for them to win the case.
                                                    Both defendant witnesses already know the robots were rushed in
                                                    development as they had discussed the distribution of
                                                    the robots directly with each other. From John Scott threatening
                                                    Jessie Smith to overlooking actual bugs at the time of
                                                    testing, there are numerous instances that clearly break the legal
                                                    elements of negligence which Evan would try to prove.
                                                    Allowing these multiple alternatives for Ethan to win helps balance
                                                    the case so it is not as heavily favored for the
                                                    defendant. The scenario would have the plaintiff following all the
                                                    elements under negligence, so the defendant would
                                                    have a tougher time trying to claim contributory negligence. This
                                                    adds potentially alternative ways for both the
                                                    plaintiff and defendant to have a chance at winning the case.
