<h5>Defendant_Friendly Witness: &nbsp; Jesse Smith, Leading software engineer</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Jesse Smith is the senior software engineer of MacRonalds who was hired by Mr. John Scott, the CEO, and
            founder of
            MacRonalds. Mr. Smith has been a software engineer for about 10 years and leading engineer for various
            MacRonalds
            projects including the system software project and the new drive-thru robot system. He loves his job and
            always makes
            sure he has produced bug-free code by verification through Test-Driven Development. He is known to have
            high work ethics
            and a friendly face around the office. The CEO, John Scott always relies on Jesse Smith to meet the
            deadline and
            accomplish beyond expected goals.

        </p><br>
        <p>
            Mr. Smith designed the new drive-thru robot for MacRonalds to better the customer service experience.
            The drive-thru
            robot was designed to follow a number of steps to prevent accidents. As the customers drive up to the
            drive-thru window,
            they are introduced to the robot with a set of instructions on how the robot functions. Mr. Smith
            designed the robot
            with human-like-hands so it can grip and ungrip the orders just like a human. He also programmed the
            robot to announce
            “Caution! Food is being delivered. Get ready to receive your order.” before handing the order to the
            customer. This
            could help prevent any unnecessary accidents during the process.

        <h5>Secret Information: <b style="font-weight: normal; margin: 10px; font-size: 20px;">[Don't tell anyone
            this unless they specifically
            confront you]</b></h5>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">

                <p>
                    Jesse Smith is respected by all the employees in the office including the C.E.O John Scott.
                    Coincidently, a MacRonalds
                    competitor was working on a similar project ahead of time and launched their product before
                    MacRonalds. So, in order to
                    finish their product before their competitor, John Scott ordered Jesse Smith to complete the
                    project months ahead of the
                    deadline. If not completed, John Scott threatened to fire him, cutting the project deadline
                    short by months. To finish
                    the project in time, the coders and testers were rushed. The software tests were indicating some
                    minor failures but it
                    was an edge-case and should function normally. So, to meet the deadline and get the product off
                    to the market, Jesse
                    Smith force-passed the tests performed.
