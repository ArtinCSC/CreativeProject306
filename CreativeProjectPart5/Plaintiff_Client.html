    <h5>Plaintiff_Client Witness: &nbsp; Ethan Turner, Victimized Customer</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Ethan Turner is a recent graduate at Eastview University of Virginia (EUV) with a Bachelor of Science
                degree in
                Management with a measly 2.7 GPA. He is a sluggish and lackadaisical individual who lives on a paycheck
                to paycheck
                basis. He is currently working as a waiter at a local Italian Bistro where his main source of income is
                from tips. Given
                his personality, he usually doesn’t make too much money on a daily basis. He dreams of eventually making
                use of his
                management degree as he watches the days pass him by.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The day of the incident started in a routine manner for Ethan as he went to his shift at the Italian
                Bistro he works at.
                At least he had a party that his roommate Babbu had arranged to look forward to. After work, he was
                exhausted as usual
                and his mood had not elevated as the party progressed. Babbu noticed that he was considerably down and
                helped cheer him
                up. This led to Ethan deciding to make a coffee run to MacRonalds to help rejuvenate his energy level.
                Babbu insisted he
                buys additional coffees and food for everybody else, as he reluctantly agreed. On that note, he swiftly
                made his way to
                the MacRonalds drive-thru and was not aware of the newly installed, automated drive-thru robot. Although
                there were
                indirect warnings of the dangers that may be encountered, a direct warning was yet to be issued. He
                ordered 10 meals of
                a standard sandwich, fries, and a hot coffee which came to a total of $89.78.

            </p><br>
            <p>
                Ethan finally pulls up to the drive-thru robot and extends a hundred dollars worth of bills in one hand
                and 78 cents in
                the other hand to pay for his meal so he does not receive any coins back in change. Since he is a
                server, he tends to
                carry an assortment of cash and tries to stay organized in that respect. Realizing too late that the
                robot has failed to
                acknowledge the payment, the robot had begun delivering Ethan’s large order of coffees. With no hands
                available, Ethan
                cannot grab the coffee in a reasonable fashion and the coffee inevitably spills all over him. After
                suffering
                second-degree burns and agonizing over it for the next couple of days, he finds a lawyer to sue
                MacRonalds as he is
                appalled that MacRonalds would approve such a dangerous machine that failed to complete a standard
                transaction that
                occurs in the process of a drive-thru.

            <h5>Secret Information:<b style="font-weight: normal; margin: 10px; font-size: 20px;">[Don't tell anyone
                    this unless they specifically
                    confront you]</b></h5>

            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Being the sluggish individual that he is, he finds himself lacking sleep on several occasions.
                        In addition to that, his
                        brother had recently passed away, which has caused him to lose even more sleep than usual. When
                        it comes to the day in
                        question, he only managed to sleep 4 hours. In addition, he had also just come off a 12-hour
                        shift which could only
                        exacerbate his grogginess further. He was clearly not in the right state of mind when going
                        through the newly automated
                        drive-thru.

                    <p>
                        A direct warning was not notified to the user of the drive-thru, which may demonstrate poor care
                        and safety to its
                        customers.

                        The robot’s malfunction was the direct cause of Ethan’s burns.

                    <p>
                        A well-programmed robot should have realized that Ethan was paying for the meal and not well
                        equipped to accept the
                        meal.

                        Second-degree burns were suffered, thus visible and brutal injury is apparent.

                        He slept only 4 hours and just came off a 12-hour shift from working as a server.

                        His grogginess may have caused him to neglect to read the signs, act in an outlier fashion, etc.

                    <p>
                        There were indirect warnings available such as signs and brochures readily available for any
                        potential user of the
                        drive-thru.
