    <h5>Defendant_Client Witness: &nbsp; John Scott, CEO of MacRonalds
    </h5>

            <p>
                John Scott is the CEO and founder of MacRonalds. He claims that Mr. Turner's injuries were
                self-inflicted and not the
                fault of the drive-thru robot. He is someone who is always looking to be ahead of the curb in the
                release and use of new
                technology in MacRonalds. If he feels threatened by a business competitor, he will not think twice about
                making drastic
                changes to his business (including employee personal).

            <h5>Secret Information: <b style="font-weight: normal; margin: 10px; font-size: 20px;">[Don't tell anyone
                    this unless they specifically
                    confront you]</b></h5>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        John Scott is a technology nerd, who loves to be ahead of the curb in releasing new technology
                        in his service. He has
                        spent a lot of money on the new drive-thru robot tech. however, while his robot was under test,
                        he noticed that his
                        business competitor is planning to release their robot drive-thru. Since he has been working on
                        this technology for a
                        while, and he believes that MacRonalds is number one in innovation, he rushes the test and
                        releasing the robot. John
                        Scott is aware that the robot is not yet ready for a public release and that it still needs a
                        couple of more months to
                        be bug-free. However, John feels immense anger and pressure to release the drive-thru robot
                        before his competitor. So,
                        he decides to confront Jesse Smith and threatens to fire him if he doesn’t release the
                        drive-thru robot. John Scott also
                        was notified a couple of days before the accident that the robot accidentally drops a meal (a
                        sandwich) as it failed to
                        detect that the customer is ready or not. It was not a big deal, as they immediately replace the
                        sandwich, so there was
                        no compliance reported.

                        The released of the robot was rushed by CEO of MacRonalds.

                        The CEO threatened to fire Jesse Smith if the robot wasn’t released immediately.

                    <p>
                        The robot was not tested properly and thoroughly, due to the rush of release.

                        The robot’s malfunction was the direct cause of Ethan’s burns.

                    <p>
                        A well-programmed robot should have realized that Ethan was not ready to accept the meal.

                        A direct warning was not notified to the user of the drive-thru, which may demonstrate poor care
                        and safety to its
                        customers.

                        Babbu Singh can make this stronger by testifying that he may have been more exhausted than Ethan
                        may be willing to
                        reveal during the MacRonalds visit.

                        Being sleep deprived may have caused Mr. Ethan to neglect to read the signs.

                        There were indirect warnings available such as signs and brochures readily available for any
                        potential user of the
                        drive-thru.
