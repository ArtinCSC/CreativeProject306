    <h5>Defendant_Client Witness: &nbsp; John Scott, CEO of MacRonalds
    </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                John Scott is the CEO and founder of MacRonalds. He’s had several years of management experience in the
                food and
                business industry prior to his entrepreneurship. He has strong connections within his network and
                continuously bests his
                competitors. He is cunning, intimidating, and tends to get what he wants. His subordinates tremble at
                his presence and
                his colleagues have nothing but respect for him. He has always been a bit of a geek when it comes to
                technology and
                relishes the idea of staying ahead of the curve.
            </p>
            <p>
                He’s been looking to integrate some of the latest and greatest technology into his chain of MacRonalds
                restaurants for a
                little while now. When he finally got the word from his lead software engineer that the automated
                drive-thru robots were
                now complete and ready for use, he immediately began rolling out this revolutionary technology to as
                many of his chains
                as he can. Now he will save hundreds and thousands of dollars on expending wages to drive-thru employees
                as well as
                playing a pivotal role in the advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Not only does this reaffirm his
                number one
                mentality as a CEO, he is on his way to becoming a world renowned public figure.

            <h5>Secret Information: <b style="font-weight: normal; margin: 10px; font-size: 20px;">[Don't tell anyone
                    this unless they specifically
                    confront you]</b></h5>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        While his robot was still in the early testing stages, one of his connections notified him that
                        his business competitor
                        is planning to release their version of the automated robot drive-thru. Since he has been
                        working on this technology for
                        a while, and he believes that MacRonalds is number one in innovation, he rushes the tests to be
                        the first to the market.
                        John Scott is made aware from his lead software engineer Jesse Smith that the robot is not yet
                        ready for a public
                        release and that it still needs a couple of more months to be bug-free. Being the person that he
                        is, he successfully
                        threatens to fire him if he doesn’t release the drive-thru robot soon, and Jesse Smith delivers
                        shortly after.

                    <p>
                        The released of the robot was rushed by CEO of MacRonalds.

                    <p>
                        The CEO threatened to fire Jesse Smith if the robot wasn’t released immediately.

                    <p>
                        The robot was not tested properly and thoroughly, due to the rush of release.

                        There were indirect warnings available such as signs and brochures readily available for any
                        potential user of the
                        drive-thru.
